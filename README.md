# WeddingPlanner
The website offers a full wedding package that initially concerns the reservation of weddings and offers all its features to the customers specifying the location , schedule, capacity and other features like photographers, singers and make-up artists. The application mainly consists of two types of users. The first type is the customer who needs the service. The other type is the person who offers the service. The application mainly links the person who needs the service to the person offering it by displaying to the customers all the offers provided by the service providers and he chooses one offer from them and the application ensures the connection between both users.
